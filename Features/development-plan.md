## Key Architecture Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL for full-text search?

Notelian uses PostgreSQL's native `tsvector` / `tsquery` for search rather than a dedicated search service like Elasticsearch or Typesense. This reduces operational complexity for the MVP — one database to manage instead of two services. The tradeoff is lower relevance tuning flexibility. If search quality becomes a limitation at scale, migrating to a dedicated search service is a clean upgrade path.

---

### Why pg-boss for notifications?

pg-boss is a job queue built on PostgreSQL. It handles notification delivery, email digest scheduling, and cleanup jobs without introducing Redis or a separate message broker. Jobs are transactional — if the triggering action (a comment save) fails, the notification job is never created. The tradeoff is that pg-boss is less efficient than Redis pub/sub at very high message throughput, which is acceptable for an MVP-scale product.

### Worker Scaling

The pg-boss worker process (`pnpm worker`) is safe to run as multiple replicas. pg-boss uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to claim job rows — two replicas cannot process the same job. All recurring queues use `policy: "exclusive"` so a slow tick never overlaps the next one across replicas.

**Concurrency rules:**
- `localConcurrency: 1` for every queue — each replica processes one job per type at a time; scale via replicas, not per-process concurrency.
- Postgres `max_connections` must cover all processes. Each worker replica uses ~20 connections (Drizzle pool) + ~10 pg-boss internal. Each Next.js process uses ~20. Set `max_connections ≥ 100` for up to 3 worker replicas.

**Job registry enforcement:** Every job name is defined in a `JOB_NAMES` enum; every entry has an explicit record in `QUEUE_OPTIONS: Record<JobName, PgBossQueueOptions>` — the TypeScript compiler fails at build time if a job is missing queue config. See [GETTING-STARTED.md §9](../GETTING-STARTED.md) for the full registry and per-job settings.

---

### Why Drizzle ORM over Prisma?

Drizzle provides a more direct mapping to SQL, better TypeScript inference, and lighter runtime overhead than Prisma. Schema changes require writing explicit migration files rather than relying on an ORM to infer them, which gives more control in production environments. The tradeoff is a steeper initial setup for developers new to Drizzle.

---

### Why TipTap over Slate or Lexical?

TipTap is built on ProseMirror, which is the most mature and battle-tested rich text editing foundation available. It has strong TypeScript support, a growing ecosystem of extensions, and Yjs integration for Phase 2 real-time collaboration. The tradeoff is that custom block types require writing ProseMirror node specs, which has a learning curve.

---

### Block storage — JSONB in PostgreSQL

Each block's content is stored as a `content` JSONB column in the `blocks` table. This allows flexible, schema-less storage of different block types without requiring a separate table per block type. Full-text indexing is maintained separately via a `search_vector` column updated by triggers.

---

## Database Schema Overview

```
Core tables:
  users, sessions, accounts, verifications
  workspaces, workspace_members
  pages (covers both pages and database entries)
  page_closure, page_versions, blocks

Database features:
  database_views
  database_properties
  property_values
  (a database is a "pages" row where kind='database' — no separate table)

Sharing:
  page_permissions
  public_links
  guest_invitations

Files:
  file_uploads
  workspace_storage_usage

Search:
  search_index

Templates:
  templates

Collaboration:
  comments
  notifications
  notification_preferences
  email_outbox

User preferences:
  user_preferences
  user_hint_states
  user_favorites
  user_recently_visited

Admin:
  platform_audit_log
```

> This lists the main tables by area; some columns and helper tables live in the per-feature specs.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Secret for Better Auth session signing |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Base URL Better Auth uses to build magic-link URLs (matches `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`) |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3-compatible storage endpoint (leave blank for the region default; set a custom endpoint URL otherwise) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Storage bucket name |
| `S3_REGION` | Bucket region (e.g. `us-east-1`, or `auto` for some providers) |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Storage access key ID |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Storage secret access key |
| `CDN_URL` | CDN base URL for serving uploaded files |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Sender address (e.g. `noreply@notelian.app`) |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname (e.g. `smtp.sendgrid.net`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port (`587` for STARTTLS, `465` for TLS) |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP authentication username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP authentication password |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `true` for TLS (port 465), `false` for STARTTLS (port 587) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public base URL (e.g. `https://notelian.app`) |
| `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY` | *Optional* — GeoIP lookup for the session list; omit to disable location display |

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in DATABASE_URL and other required variables

# Generate + apply database migrations
pnpm run db:generate     # build migration SQL from the Drizzle schema
pnpm run db:migrate      # apply migrations to the database

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Start the background-job worker (separate terminal)
pnpm run worker          # pg-boss — notifications, email digests, cleanup jobs
```

> `pnpm run dev` alone does **not** process background jobs (email digests, trash auto-delete, version pruning, stale-upload cleanup). Run `pnpm run worker` in a second terminal or those features silently do nothing. See [GETTING-STARTED.md](../GETTING-STARTED.md) §8.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v20+, PostgreSQL v16+

---

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Tool | Coverage target |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Unit tests | Vitest | Business logic, utilities |
| Integration tests | Vitest + real PostgreSQL | API routes, database queries |
| E2E tests | Playwright | Critical user flows (sign up, create page, invite member) |

---

## Deployment

**Production stack:**
- Next.js app: Vercel (or Railway)
- PostgreSQL: Supabase / Neon / Railway managed PostgreSQL
- File storage: S3-compatible object storage + CDN
- Email: Nodemailer (SMTP)

> **Real-time (SSE) hosting constraint:** The notification SSE stream (`GET /api/notifications/stream`) is a long-lived connection and must run on a host that supports persistent connections (**Railway** or a VM/long-lived Node server). Vercel serverless functions cap stream duration and will drop the connection, so either host that route on Railway or rely on the client's `EventSource` auto-reconnect + polling fallback (the Notification Center stays the durable source of truth). See [notifications.md](notifications.md).

**CI/CD:**
- Push to `main` → automated tests → deploy to production
- Push to feature branch → automated tests → preview deployment
